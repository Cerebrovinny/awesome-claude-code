Just a quick update to let folks know that I'm going to be working through the backlog of submissions as soon as I can, as I've been unable to attend much to the repo this past week, so thanks to everyone who is contributing and apologies for any delays. Also, I'll be adding GitHub stats to the GitHub resources in the list, since some people have requested the ability to see "star counts", but I want to do it in a a way that is mindful of the fact that I'm often adding very new repositories, so star count alone is not always a super strong signal with respect to quality (to put it one way, part of the purpose of this repo is to highlight projects that are awesome but don't have visibility). Also, keep in mind this is a _curated_ list of Claude Code resources, so although I don't often reject proposals because I don't think they're awesome, I also do take time to vet the resources for quality and security (which also means I have to take the time to test-drive every submission, otherwise it would just be a mega-list). So, hopefully more updates and more additions to come soon - and another reminder to please use the **Issues** tab to submit resources - moving forward, I'll ask anyone who submits a resource via a Pull Request to re-submit using the Issue - Resource Submission Form, which is in decent working order and 100x simpler for all parties. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details. Thanks! Keep flibbertidaddling!
